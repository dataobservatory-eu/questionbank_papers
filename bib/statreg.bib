Together with the general quality management principles, the {ES} {CoP} and the {ESS} {QAF} constitute the common quality framework of the {ESS}, based on which high-quality European Statistics are developed, produced and disseminated.

This self-regulatory common quality framework complements the extensive legal framework of the {ESS} that is based on Regulation ({EC}) No 223/2009 on European Statistics which itself derives from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.},
