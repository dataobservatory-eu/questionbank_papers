	abstract = {In the music domain, several ontologies have been proposed to annotate musical data, in both symbolic and audio form, and generate semantically rich Music Knowledge Graphs. However, current models lack interoperability and are insufficient for representing music history and the cultural heritage context in which it was generated; risking the propagation of recency and cultural biases to downstream applications. In this article, we propose the Polifonia Ontology Network ({PON}) for music cultural heritage, centred around four modules: Music Meta (metadata), Representation (content), Source (provenance) and Instrument (cultural objects). We design {PON} with a strong accent on cultural stakeholder requirements and competency questions ({CQs}), contributing an {NLP}-based toolkit to support knowledge engineers in generating, validating, and analysing them; and a novel, high-quality {CQ} dataset produced as a result. We show current and future use of these resources by internal project pilots, early adopters in the music industry, and opportunities for the Semantic Web and Music Information Retrieval communities.},

	abstract = {Ontology Design Patterns ({ODPs}) support reusability and use of best practices in ontology engineering. Previous studies have shown that Content {ODPs}, in particular, have some measurable beneficial effects on the produced ontologies. However, another conclusion was that methodology and tool support was needed. Now such support exist, in the form of the {XD} methodology and the {XD} Tools. In this paper we present a set of experiments for (i) confirming previous conclusions concerning the usefulness of Content {ODPs}, (ii) investigating the usefulness of the {XD} methodology, and (iii) investigating the usefulness of the {XD} Tools. Main conclusions are that we can confirm most of the previous results concerning the usefulness of Content {ODPs}, and certain negative effects observed previously are now mitigated by the new tool support. The tool is perceived as quite useful, however it also adds some overhead. The {XD} methodology is found to be a helpful means to organize the design process, and the main benefit shown through the experiments is the testing focus, resulting in a drastic decrease of certain frequent mistakes.},

Some distinctions are drawn between kinds of ontology design patterns. Some content-oriented patterns are presented in order to illustrate their utility at different degrees of abstraction, and how they can be specialized or composed. The proposed framework and the initial set of patterns are designed in order to function as a pipeline connecting domain modelling, user requirements, and ontology-driven tasks/queries to be executed.},

	abstract = {Ontology Design Patterns ({ODPs}) have become an established and recognised practice for guaranteeing good quality ontology engineering. There are several {ODP} repositories where {ODPs} are shared as well as ontology design methodologies recommending their reuse. Performing rigorous testing is recommended as well for supporting ontology maintenance and validating the resulting resource against its motivating requirements. Nevertheless, it is less than straightforward to find guidelines on how to apply such methodologies for developing domain-specific knowledge graphs. {ArCo} is the knowledge graph of Italian Cultural Heritage and has been developed by using {eXtreme} Design ({XD}), an {ODP}- and test-driven methodology. During its development, {XD} has been adapted to the need of the {CH} domain e.g. gathering requirements from an open, diverse community of consumers, a new {ODP} has been defined and many have been specialised to address specific {CH} requirements. This paper presents {ArCo} and describes how to apply {XD} to the development and validation of a {CH} knowledge graph, also detailing the (intellectual) process implemented for matching the encountered modelling problems to {ODPs}. Relevant contributions also include a novel web tool for supporting unit-testing of knowledge graphs, a rigorous evaluation of {ArCo}, and a discussion of methodological lessons learned during {ArCo}’s development.},
